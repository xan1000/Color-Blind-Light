# Color Blind Light

A simple light `color theme` for `Visual Studio Code` for those with color blindness. This theme makes all text black
with a white background.

Whilst editors with syntax using various colors is helpful, for some with color blindness it can make it harder to read
instead of easier. Most of the existing Visual Studio Code color blind themes all appear to include using a mixture of
colors, however there was no theme that removed the coloring entirely of which I thought some would like to have an
option to simplying make all text black.
